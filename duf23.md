## Immunolabeling cell wall epitopes in mutant plants

**Project description:** Pectins are the most complex polysaccharides of plant cell walls, with an estimated 67 transferases expected to be involved in their biosynthesis, most of which have not been identified. β-1,4-Galactans constitute a major part of pectin as side chains of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I). Glycosyltransferase family GT92 comprises three β-1,4-galactan synthases (GALS1-3) in Arabidopsis, which catalyze the addition of galactose units from UDP-Gal to growing β-1,4-galactan chains. I characterized a highly conserved gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase related to GT family 92, Galactan Synthase- Like (GSL). Characterization of the GSL enzyme could provide an approach to engineering plants with an increased ratio of C6 to C5 sugars, a key objective for production of second-generation biofuel.

**Result:** I found that, like the GALS overexpressors and mutants, the plants did not have an obvious growth phenotype. The cell walls of GSL silenced and overexpressor plants to have altered glycan linkages consistent with a role in β-1,4-galactan biosynthesis.

**Figure 1.** CoMPP analysis of CDTA and NaOH-soluble fractions of NbGSL-silenced cell wall material. Data show the percent difference in relative mean signal of silenced lines compared to control. Both analytes had reduced β-1,4-galactose (LM5) detection as well as altered AGP profiling.

**Figure 2.** ELISA analysis of fractionated cell wall material from leaf tissue of plants overexpressing GSL with selected plant-glycan directed monoclonal antibodies. Heat map shows differences in antibody binding in 35s:AtGSL plants compared to wild type. Compared with wild type, xyloglucan and pectin epitopes were decreased in easily-extractable fractions and enriched in the more tightly-bound cell wall fractions. AGP epitope profiles were differentially altered, with an overall increase across fractions.

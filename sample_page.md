## Visualizing protein expression heterosis in maize

**Project description:** Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, refers to the superior performance of F1 hybrids relative to their inbred parents. The agriculture industry has taken advantage of this phenomenon in both crop and livestock breeding for centuries. Despite the importance of heterosis in agriculture, its molecular underpinnings have persisted as an unsolved classical problem in biology since its initial report by Charles Darwin. Studies of heterosis have been challenging as there are few instances of gene expression outside mid-parental range in hybrids. We employed both transcriptomics and proteomics using multiplexed tandem mass tag labeling to compare maize hybrids to their inbred parents. We found that the abundance of plastid protein complexes, consisting of subunits encoded by both the nucleus and the plastid, are elevated in hybrids relative to mid-parent levels, which may account for the greater photosynthetic capacity of hybrids. This pattern was not reflected in their transcriptomes.

In the figure above, the x-axes show that protein expression of Photosynthesis-Associated Nuclear Genes (PhANGs), Photosynthesis-Associated Plastid Genes (PhAPGs), Nuclear-Encoded (NE) ribosomes and Plastid-Encoded (PE) ribosomes are consistently expressed above mid-parent levels in hybrids. The y-axes show that expression of these proteins is variable across different inbred parents.

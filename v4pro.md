## Project 2: Comparison of maize genome annotation versions

### Comparison of maize genome annotation versions

I found there to be 12,724 unique proteins in my dataset, with v4 being the most inclusive at 11,971 proteins. However, v2 contained the most unique proteins not represented in the other three genome versions.

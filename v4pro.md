## Comparison of maize genome annotation versions

**Project description:** Several versions of the maize genome have been published to date, with some containing more genes than others. This presents a challenge for proteomics studies, as choosing which genome version to search against can alter the conclusions of the study. I sought to develop a new gene set that represented the nonredundant sum of each version. Using a protein preparation from maize tissue, I conducted multiplexed tandem mass tag labeling and mass spectrometry and searched against four published genome annotations: NCBI, Uniprot, v2, and v4.

**Result:** I found there to be 12,724 unique proteins in my dataset, with v4 being the most inclusive at 11,971 proteins. However, v2 contained the most unique proteins not represented in the other three genome versions.

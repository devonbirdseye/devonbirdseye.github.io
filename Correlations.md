## Correlations between expression heterosis and plant height heterosis

**Project description:**  Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, refers to the superior performance of F1 hybrids relative to their inbred parents. The agriculture industry has utilized this phenomenon in both crop and livestock breeding for centuries, despite the additional time and labor required for hybrid breeding programs. The molecular underpinnings of heterosis have persisted as an unsolved classical problem in biology since its initial report by Charles Darwin. Studies have found few instances of gene expression outside mid-parental range in hybrids, providing little explanation for the disparity in phenotype. We employed both transcriptomics and proteomics using multiplexed tandem mass tag labeling to compare expression levels in maize hybrids to that of their inbred parents.

**Result:** I calculated the Pearson correlations between expression heterosis (hybrid/mid-parent protein expression) and plant height heterosis (hybrid/midparent plant height) across a panel of fifteen diverse hybrids. Ribosomal proteins were the most positively correlated protein groups, while stress-response proteins were the most negatively correlated, suggesting an altered growth-defense tradeoff in hybrids. mRNA levels were less correlated with plant height than protein levels, indicating a role of post-transcriptional regulation in heterosis. In the figure below, density curves represent the Pearson correlations between expression heterosis and plant height heterosis for groups of proteins that were significantly correlated.

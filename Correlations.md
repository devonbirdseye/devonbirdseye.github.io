## Correlations between expression heterosis and plant height heterosis

I calculated the Pearson correlations between expression heterosis (hybrid/mid-parent protein expression) and plant height heterosis (hybrid/midparent plant height) across a panel of fifteen diverse hybrids. Ribosomal proteins were the most positively correlated protein groups, while stress-response proteins were the most negatively correlated, suggesting an altered growth-defense tradeoff in hybrids. mRNA levels were less correlated with plant height than protein levels, indicating a role of post-transcriptional regulation in heterosis. In the figure below, density curves represent the Pearson correlations between expression heterosis and plant height heterosis for groups of proteins that were significantly correlated.

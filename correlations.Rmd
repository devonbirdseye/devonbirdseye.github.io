## Project 1: Investigation of the molecular basis of heterosis using proteomics and transcriptomics

### Correlations between expression heterosis and plant height heterosis

Utilizing a panel of fifteen diverse hybrids, I calculated the Pearson correlations between expression heterosis (hybrid/mid-parent protein expression) in seedling leaves and plant height heterosis (hybrid/mid-parent plant height) in adult plants. Ribosomal proteins were the most positively correlated protein groups, while stress-response proteins were the most negatively correlated, suggesting an altered growth-defense trade-off in hybrids. These expression patterns could be used as a seedling biomarker for hybrid performance in agriculture breeding programs. mRNA levels were less correlated with plant height than protein levels, indicating a role of post-transcriptional regulation in heterosis. In the figure below, density curves represent the Pearson correlations between expression heterosis and plant height heterosis for groups of proteins that were significantly correlated.

## High-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) analysis of mutants

**Project description:** Pectins are the most complex polysaccharides of plant cell walls, with an estimated 67 transferases expected to be involved in their biosynthesis, most of which have not been identified. β-1,4-Galactans constitute a major part of pectin as side chains of rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I). Glycosyltransferase family GT92 comprises three β-1,4-galactan synthases (GALS1-3) in Arabidopsis, which catalyze the addition of galactose units from UDP-Gal to growing β-1,4-galactan chains. I characterized a highly conserved gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase related to GT family 92, Galactan Synthase- Like (GSL). Characterization of the GSL enzyme could provide an approach to engineering plants with an increased ratio of C6 to C5 sugars, a key objective for production of second-generation biofuel.

**Result:** I found that overexpression of GSL in Arabidopsis resulted in plants with a 30% increase in accumulated galactose, while the loss-of-function mutant had a 20% reduction in galactose accumulation. Cell wall galactose content of the quadruple loss-of-function mutant in GALS1-3 and GSL was not significantly different from that of the GALS triple mutant, indicating GSL may act in the same pathway of GALS. Co-overexpression of GSL and GALS1 resulted in plants with 75% higher total cell wall galactose compared to plants overexpressing GALS1 alone, suggesting a non-redundant molecular function.

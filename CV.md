## Comparison of the CV of proteomics to transcriptomics

**Project description:** Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, refers to the superior performance of F1 hybrids relative to their inbred parents. The agriculture industry has utilized this phenomenon in both crop and livestock breeding for centuries, despite the additional time and labor required for hybrid breeding programs. The molecular underpinnings of heterosis have persisted as an unsolved classical problem in biology since its initial report by Charles Darwin. Studies have found few instances of gene expression outside mid-parental range in hybrids, providing little explanation for the disparity in phenotype. We employed both transcriptomics and proteomics using multiplexed tandem mass tag labeling to compare expression levels in maize hybrids to that of their inbred parents.

**Result:** For our method of multiplexed proteomics using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, the median coefficient of variation (CV) between biological replicates was approximately 4-fold lower than that of transcriptomics. The violin plot below represents the median CV of the B73xMo17 hybrid biological replicates for proteins compared to their corresponding transcripts. Data represent three independent experiments.

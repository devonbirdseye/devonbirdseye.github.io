## Correlations between expression heterosis and plant height heterosis

**Project description:** Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, refers to the superior performance of F1 hybrids relative to their inbred parents. The agriculture industry has taken advantage of this phenomenon in both crop and livestock breeding for centuries. Despite the importance of heterosis in agriculture, its molecular underpinnings have persisted as an unsolved classical problem in biology since its initial report by Charles Darwin. Studies of heterosis have been challenging as there are few instances of gene expression outside mid-parental range in hybrids. We employed both transcriptomics and proteomics using multiplexed tandem mass tag labeling to compare maize hybrids to their inbred parents (Inbred lines B73, Mo17, A682, B84, and Recombinant Inbred Lines M0014, M0016, M0021, and M0317).

**Result:** I found that, for our method of proteomics, the median coefficient of variation (CV) between biological replicates was approximately 4-fold lower than that of transcriptomics.

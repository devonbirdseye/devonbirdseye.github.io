## Comparison of precision in proteomics versus transcriptomics

For our method of multiplexed proteomics using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, the median coefficient of variation (CV) between biological replicates was approximately 4-fold lower than that of transcriptomics. The violin plot below represents the median CV of the B73xMo17 hybrid biological replicates for proteins compared to their corresponding transcripts. Data represent three independent experiments.

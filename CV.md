## Project 1: Investigation of the molecular basis of heterosis using proteomics and transcriptomics
### Comparison of precision in proteomics versus transcriptomics

For our method of multiplexed proteomics using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, the median coefficient of variation (CV) between biological replicates was approximately 4-fold lower than that of transcriptomics. I visualized this difference in the violin plot below, which represents the CV of biological replicates from paired transcriptomic and proteomic datasets.
